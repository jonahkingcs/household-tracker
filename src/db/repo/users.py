"""
users.py â€” Repository helpers for User entities.

This module provides a thin abstraction over SQLAlchemy queries
for the `User` model. Repository helpers are responsible for:

- Listing all users (ordered by name)
- Creating a new user
- Activating/deactivating an existing user

These functions are intentionally simple wrappers around SQLAlchemy
so that UI code (dialogs, views) does not need to know about query syntax.
